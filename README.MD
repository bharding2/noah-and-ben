DOM - Javascript representation of HTML structure
  - standard DOM API (createElement, appendChild, etc)

Data Structures
  - objects as data stores
  - Object Oriented Programming (constructor function, initiating objects with new keyword)

Why Javascript is great
  - language of the web.  the ONLY language native to web browsers
  - increasingly used outside of the browser with the advent of node.js (chrome's javascript processor brought out of the browser so you can use it anywhere, even from the command line)
